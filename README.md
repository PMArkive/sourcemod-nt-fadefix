# sourcemod-nt-fadefix

This plugin blocks any user messages used to remove the fade-to-black effect for competitive play where the fade should not be removed.
It also periodically re-draws the fade to ensure it's still being applied.

The plugin will also enable the fade-to-black on new round, so that players can't spectate their opponents' team composition and loadouts
before spawning in themselves.

## Compile requirements
- SourceMod 1.7 or newer.
